## About me
I started programming in 4th grade, when I was 11. I started programming after I become interested in [Roblox](https://roblox.com) games. One day I just found the [Roblox Studio](https://www.roblox.com/create) program on my desktop and being curious as a child I opened it. That was a rabit hole that lead me to learn [lua-u](https://luau-lang.org/), 3D modeling with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), using external code editors, and etc. That then transpired me into learning vanilla [lua](https://lua.org). Nowadays I don't do Roblox development or any game development at that, but I might want to revist it in the future. Now it's more web-dev or exploring new languages or technologies I haven't learned before. I love statically typed languages which is why I'll always choose TypeScript over JavaScript. 

Oh yeah and I use linux btw:tm:.
